//! A 16-item GPT-OSS-120B layer-tile megakernel for gfx950.
//!
//! This is an architecture-shaped slice, not a claim to execute the complete
//! 120B checkpoint in one dispatch. Each Wave64 owns one independent bounded
//! item covering one eight-query-head GQA group, 16 cached tokens, 16 of 64
//! value channels, the full 2,880-by-128 router, and one 128-by-16 MXFP4 tile
//! from the selected top-1 expert. Attention rows 8..16 and expert rows 1..16
//! are native-instruction padding.
