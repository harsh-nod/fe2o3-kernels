# GEMM autoresearch program

Your goal is to improve the geometric-mean BF16/F32 GEMM throughput reported by
`evaluate.py` on one gfx942 GPU without changing the operation it computes.

## Scope

- You may edit only `src/kernel.rs`.
- Do not edit `evaluate.py`, `src/main.rs`, `src/reference.rs`, `run-gfx942.sh`,
  `Cargo.toml`, or the repository compiler/runtime.
- Preserve `gemm_autoresearch_v1`, its ABI, dynamic dimensions and strides,
  alpha/beta epilogue, edge behavior, output ownership, and wave64 target.
- Never skip the production fe2o3 extraction or independent numerical check.
- Do not specialize on zero benchmark inputs or the published benchmark sizes.

## Loop

1. Read the current kernel and form one concrete performance hypothesis.
2. Make one attributable change in `src/kernel.rs`.
3. Run `ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<one-id> python3 evaluate.py --label <short-name>`.
4. Reject any compile, verifier, lowering, ISA, launch, or numerical failure.
5. Compare the median score across three fresh processes. Keep the edit only if
   the score improves and no size shows a material regression outside noise.
6. Record what changed and why in the untracked `results.tsv` ledger.
7. Continue until the time budget expires. Re-run the winner from a clean build
   before publishing a performance claim.

Useful hypotheses include removing redundant staging, changing reuse geometry,
unrolling the K loop, reducing live fragments, changing workgroup tiling, and
separating edge and interior paths. Every change must remain expressible through
the supported safe fe2o3 device API and pass its generic compiler checks.

The score is a search signal, not a state-of-the-art claim. Shared-host load,
clock state, thermal state, input distribution, and a narrow shape set can all
change the result.
